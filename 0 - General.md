## What it is / isn't

These guidelines <u>do not teach</u> you C#/.NET from scratch.

They are also <u>not a specification</u> of the C# language or .NET environment.

They <u>describe best practices</u> how to use C#/.NET.

They are also <u>not a silver bullet</u> to magically solve problems or ensure good quality.

And they can also be objectively wrong. [Feel free to document any issues](https://github.com/RotenInformatik/RI_CodingGuidelines/issues).

## It's a matter of taste - to some degree

Keep in mind that some of the rules are purely a matter of taste (while others are logically justifiable).

For example, most of the rules in the C# part are more taste-dependent than the .NET type usage rules.

In general, the guidelines are written with the following in mind:

* Code Readability
* Code Debugability
* Code Maintainability
* Software Reliability
